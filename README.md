Argostimè is a web-app to keep an eye on prices in webshops. The name is derived from
Argos, the mythical giant with a hundred eyes, and "timè", Greek for price.

Argostimè is based on Flask and SQLAlchemy and has a modular structure so new shops can
be added easily.

The "official" version of Argostimè is available at [argostime.mrtijn.nl](https://argostime.mrtijn.nl/).
